Hello!

I’m Kayla Lane. I like crotchting, walking, and learning languages.

I like frontend development because I like seeing results. I see something cool, and I want to do that. Each project has many milestones, so there’s always room for improvement.

My focus is accessibility, including international access through translations. Language learning is a big part of my life, so I can't wait to combine coding and learning languages into a project I’m proud of. I’m currently learning Spanish and Korean. If you need a new language partner, my contact is below!

My current goal is to master React & React performance. I plan to keep the blog updated. So stay tuned!
